I try to relax, nervous of my arousal being discovered.

You focus on slowing your breathing, trying to ease the tension in your body as you lie face-down on the massage table. Yuki’s hands work into your upper back, her fingers pressing hard into the muscle along your shoulders. The oil makes her touch slick, sliding over your skin with a faint wet sound. Each knead sends a dull pressure through your tissue, and you feel the heat of her palms spreading across your back. Your skin prickles slightly under the constant contact, hyper-aware of every movement.

Your penis remains hard, pressed between your abdomen and the padded table. The weight of your body on it creates a persistent ache, a mix of pressure and trapped heat. The towel over your lower half feels rough against the sensitive skin of your buttocks and thighs, shifting slightly with each of Yuki’s movements. You try to keep your hips still, but the arousal pulses in your lower abdomen, a tight warmth that won’t subside. The fear of her noticing adds a sharpness to your awareness, your muscles tensing involuntarily.

Yuki moves her hands down your back again, working the middle section. Her thumbs press along your spine, the force pushing your torso slightly into the table. You feel the stretch in your lower back muscles, the oil warming under her touch. Your breathing catches for a moment as her fingers glide closer to the towel’s edge, but she stays professional, her movements focused. The sensation of her hands so near your pelvis only heightens the tension in your groin. Your penis throbs once, the head rubbing against the table through your body’s weight, sending a jolt of sensation through you.

She shifts her position, stepping to the side of the table. You hear the faint rustle of her short robe as she moves. Her hands continue their rhythm, now working on your sides, her fingers curling slightly around your ribcage. The contact sends a faint tickle through your skin, mixing with the deeper pressure of the massage. Your arousal remains, a constant undercurrent, and you focus on keeping your body limp, hoping the towel conceals the evidence. The warmth of the room and the oil on your skin make every touch feel amplified, and you’re unsure if she’s noticed any change in your posture or breathing.

I try to keep things under control, but fail, my arousal building.  My only hope is that she doesn't ask me to roll over and/or that the towel doesn't fall.

You lie face-down on the massage table, trying to steady your breathing and keep your body relaxed. Yuki’s hands continue their work on your sides, her fingers pressing into the muscles along your ribcage. The oil on your skin makes her touch slick, gliding with a faint wet sound. Each press of her palms sends a wave of heat through your back, and you feel the slight drag of her fingertips as they move. Your skin feels hypersensitive, every contact amplified by the warmth of the room and the lingering scent of floral oil.

Your penis remains hard, trapped between your abdomen and the padded table. The pressure of your own weight on it creates a constant, dull ache. Each small shift of your hips, even unintentional, causes the sensitive head to rub against the surface beneath you, sending sharp jolts of sensation through your groin. The arousal builds further, a tight heat spreading through your lower abdomen. Your pelvic muscles tense involuntarily, and you feel a faint throb in your shaft, the need for release growing stronger. The towel over your lower half feels precarious, the fabric barely covering your buttocks, and you’re acutely aware of its slight shifts with Yuki’s movements.

Yuki’s hands move lower again, kneading the muscles just above the towel. Her thumbs press into your lower back, the force pushing your hips slightly into the table. You feel the stretch in your muscles there, mixed with the persistent tension in your groin. The proximity of her touch to your pelvis only heightens the sensation, your penis twitching once against the table, the friction sending another wave of heat through you. You focus on keeping still, but the effort makes your thighs tremble slightly, the strain of holding back adding to the physical intensity.

She steps back for a moment, and you hear the click of the oil bottle again. The sound of liquid being poured into her hands follows, then the slick noise of her rubbing her palms together. Your breathing is shallow now, despite your efforts to control it. The fear of the towel slipping or her asking you to turn over sits heavy in your chest. Your skin feels flushed, the heat of arousal mixing with the warmth of the oil already on your body. Yuki returns to the table, her hands hovering near your lower back again, and you brace yourself for the next touch, unsure how much longer you can maintain control.

You lie face-down on the massage table, muscles tense as you prepare for Yuki’s next move. Your breathing is shallow, each inhale and exhale deliberate as you try to keep your body under control. The towel over your lower half feels like a fragile barrier, barely covering your buttocks, and you’re hyper-aware of its slight weight against your skin. The padded surface beneath you presses into your chest and abdomen, grounding you, but also amplifying the ache in your groin.

Your penis remains hard, trapped between your body and the table. The pressure of your weight on it creates a constant, throbbing discomfort. Every small shift, even the tiniest adjustment of your hips, causes the sensitive head to rub against the surface, sending sharp pulses of heat through your shaft and into your lower abdomen. The arousal is unrelenting now, a tight knot of tension that makes your pelvic muscles clench involuntarily. Your thighs feel strained from the effort of staying still, a faint tremor running through them.

Yuki’s hands return to your lower back, warm and slick with fresh oil. Her fingers press into the muscles just above the towel, the force pushing your hips slightly downward. You feel the stretch in your lower back, the heat of the oil seeping into your skin. Her thumbs work in small circles, gliding over the oiled surface with a wet, slippery sound. The proximity of her touch to your pelvis sends a fresh wave of sensation through you, your penis twitching once against the table, the friction intensifying the ache.

She adjusts her position, stepping closer to the side of the table. You hear the faint rustle of her short robe as she moves. Her hands continue their rhythm, now sliding along the sides of your lower back, her fingertips brushing just under the edge of the towel. The contact sends a tingle through your skin, mixing with the deeper pressure of her massage. Your heart rate quickens, the fear of the towel slipping or her noticing your arousal adding to the tension. The warmth of her palms and the slickness of the oil make every touch feel heightened, and you remain braced, unsure of what she’ll do next.
